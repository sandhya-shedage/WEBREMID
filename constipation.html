	<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;padding:4px;text-indent:3%;">Having fewer than three bowel movements a week is, technically, the definition of constipation. However, how often you “go” varies widely from person to person. Some people have bowel movements several times a day while others have them only one to two times a week. Whatever your bowel movement pattern is, it’s unique and normal for you – as long as you don’t stray too far from your pattern.</p>


<p align="justify" style="font-size:19px;"><b>
Regardless of your bowel pattern, one fact is certain:</b><br></p>

<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;padding:4px;">
The longer you go before you “go,” the more difficult it becomes for stool/poop to pass.
